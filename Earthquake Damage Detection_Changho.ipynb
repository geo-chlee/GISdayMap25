    "\n",
    "> Earthquakes cause severe surface and economic damage, especially in urban areas, yet limited research integrates land parcel–based data with remotely sensed observations for damage assessment. Traditionally, remote sensing (RS) and socio-economic GIS analyses have been conducted separately—RS focuses on pixel-based surface changes, while GIS relies on survey-based damage records. This study bridges these two approaches by integrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry with cadastral parcel data containing land-use information. Spatial statistical methods such as local Moran’s <i>I</i> and Lee’s <i>L</i> bivariate local spatial association are used. Focusing on the November 15, 2017, Pohang earthquake—the most economically destructive earthquake in South Korea—the results revealed distinct spatial regimes: natural areas such as forests and rice paddies dominated high–high clusters, while artificial surfaces like building sites and roads characterized low–low clusters. Bivariate analysis further identified high-loss-coherence/high-displacement zones as key indicators of earthquake-induced damage. This integrated approach demonstrates how combining differential interferometric SAR and spatial autocorrelation improves the detection of seismic impacts by enhancing urban resilience and guiding post-disaster spatial planning.\n",

A High-High (HH) cluster represents parcels with coherence change values higher than the mean (−0.03m), surrounded by six neighboring parcels that also exceed the mean. Conversely, a Low-Low (LL) cluster indicates parcels and their neighbors with values lower than the mean. Reflecting the spatial pattern of coherence change, HH clusters are primarily concentrated in the central to northern portions of the study area, whereas LL clusters dominate the southern to eastern parts."

Notably, one of these clusters—the downtown area of Heunghae-eup—corresponded to the most socio-economic damaged region (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>).\n",
